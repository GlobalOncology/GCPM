Elucidating the in vivo role of Pyk2 in cancer metastasis,"Over the past few years, imaging technologies and experiments have helped to visualize the dynamics of cellular movements, the signaling pathways, and the nature of tumor-stroma interactions involved in the various stages of the metastatic process. Thus, insights from live imaging could ultimately shed light on how to effectively treat cancer metastasis. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2 is highly expressed in invasive cancers, but the mechanism through which it regulates invasion and metastasis are currently unknown. Using in vivo mice models and high-resolution intravital imaging, the project described herein aims to explore the cellular mechanisms by which Pyk2 controls breast tumor cell dissemination from the primary tumor and spreading to distant sites throughout the body. We hope to translate the results from the proposed study into novel strategies for predicting the invasive potential of breast carcinoma and, more importantly, for blocking breast cancer metastasis.",http://www.uicc.org/programmes/geti/our-activities/study-grants,,"Joel Alter, John Condeelis",12/14/2016,2/15/2016,TRUE,FALSE,"Bar-Ilan University - Begin Building, Ramat-Gan, Israel",,Ramat-Gan,Israel,,32.068424,34.824785,
Targeting RNASEH2A-IKKi signal in nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"We hypothesize that RNASEH2A promotes NPC genesis through IKKi signaling, inhibition of RNASEH2A and/or IKKi would be a high-efficient way to prevent and block NPC development. We will investigate whether genetically and pharmaceutically inhibiting RNASEH2A and/or IKKi blocks NPC development in mouse models, and whether the tumor-promoting function of RNASEH2A is dependent on IKKi signaling. We firmly believe that our studies will lead to development of novel strategies for the treatment and prevention of human NPC.",http://www.uicc.org/programmes/geti/our-activities/study-grants,,"Xueping Feng, Jun-Li Luo",5/14/2016,8/14/2016,TRUE,FALSE,"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University 87 Xiangya Road",,Changsha,China,,28.213361,112.983487,
A new Bayesian approach to investigate the effect of socio-economic disparities on cancer burden in Italy,"This project aims at investigating the role of socio-economic disparities on cancer burden in Italy. Aggregated data will be used for a spatio-temporal analysis. The main problems encountered in using aggregated data are, on one hand, the measure of area socio economic status and, on the other hand, the possibility of controlling the statistical analysis for area-specific characteristic, such as environmental exposures, lifestyle factors, differences in medical care and presence of screening programs. These factors are likely to make the extent of cancer burden heterogeneously distributed across the areas. Innovative statistical methods need to be developed to monitor and study socio-economic disparities on cancer outcomes. In a multilevel hierarchical model, area and individual level socio-economic data will be integrated. Finally, a Bayesian spatio-temporal model for aggregated disease count data will be developed in order to, among other features, correct for spatial confounding.",http://www.uicc.org/programmes/geti/our-activities/study-grants,,"Maura Mezzetti, Francesca Dominici",2/15/2016,5/15/2016,TRUE,FALSE,,,Rome,Italy,,41.853405,12.624571,
Assessment of the role of diabetes treatment and duration on breast cancer incidence in women,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and breast cancer (BC) are complex diseases. Genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors are thought to interplay in their pathogenesis. Little is known about the biological mechanisms by which diabetes may affect breast cancer incidence and mortality. Specifically, the role of diabetes treatment in breast carcinogenesis remains unknown. My stage at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) will allow me to access information of large cohort studies and I will be able to learn how to handle and analyse complex data. Among my acquired skills will be to do risk to BC assessment using Cox Regression; to conduct a meta-analysis and to analyse direct, indirect and interactive effects between obesity and BC, and also between physical activity and BC using Structural equation models.",http://www.uicc.org/programmes/geti/our-activities/study-grants,,"Hortensia Moreno Macias, Isabelle Romieu ",5/14/2016,7/14/2016,TRUE,FALSE,"Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa, Colonia Vicentina",,Mexico City,Mexico,,19.382975,-99.155158,

Establishment of Epstein-Barr virus infection ex vivo models in healthy and pre-malignant nasopharyngeal epithelial cell cultures,"Great improvements have been made in understanding the role of B cells in EBV persistence in vivo due to the accessibility of infected primary B lymphocytes in the blood and lymph nodes, and the availability of an in vitro infection system. Although a variety of in vitro epithelial cell culture model for EBV infection have been explored, they may not closely represent the situation in nasopharynx. The failure to detect infected epithelial cells in vivo and the lack of an accurate in vitro nasopharyngeal epithelial culture model have severely hampered this kind of research.

Optimization of Notch inhibitors for treatment of cancer and tumour angiogensis,"Objective of this project is to optimise Notch inhibitors for the treatment of cancer cells and tumour associated angiogenesis. We hypothesise that there is a bi-directional cross talk between cancer cells and endothelial cells in their microenvironment, which acts to promote cancer growth and invasion, as well as malignant neo-angiogenesis. We further hypothesise that Notch signalling is one of the key mediators of this cross talk, and that depending on the pattern of expression of Notch receptors and ligands between cancer cells and endothelial cells, the nature of this cross talk, and therefore cancer aggressiveness and response to distinct Notch inhibitors will be different. This would imply that in order to choose the optimal Notch inhibitor for each patient in the clinic, we need to know the nature of this intricate crosstalk.",http://www.uicc.org/programmes/geti/our-activities/beginning-investigators,,"Aleksandra Filipovic, Jan Kitajewski",5/14/2016,4/15/2016,TRUE,FALSE,Imperial College School of Medicine,Hammersmith Campus Du Cane Road,London,United Kingdom,,51.491188,-0.223731,

We believe that HPV-positive OPSCC is more prevalent compared HPV-negative OPSCC among HIV patients and that HIV-infected patients receiving appropriate antiretroviral therapy (ART) have worse outcomes compared to HIV non-infected patients after controlling for HPV. To develop the preliminary data required to assess these critical questions, we will conduct a cohort study on all patients receiving treatment for OPSCC in Botswana in order to determine the relative contribution of HPV to the overall burden of OPSCC in the country.

However, due to lack of the knowledge on involvement of specific HDAC(s) in Xi maintenance, the HDACi treatment results in several side effects due to the overlapping functions among the HDACs. Furthermore, research has established a link between BRCA1 and XIST (a long non-coding RNA responsible for maintenance of Xi), BRCA1 and HDAC and Xi and hypoacetylation.

Compound screening for the identification of LMTK3 kinase-inhibitors,"One of the most important pathways in breast cancer involves estrogen. Estrogen binds to Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERa) and stimulates cells to turnover more rapidly - this is the major pathway in breast cancer but one we do not know how to fully control, especially when it becomes resistant or unresponsive to regular treatments like tamoxifen. However, ERa may also be controlled by other proteins, called kinases, and because both ERa and kinases are so important, we want to study the type of transcriptional control that kinases cause. We have recently identified a novel kinase (LMTK3) that regulated ERa activity and its functions. In addition we discovered that LMTK3 is also implicated in metastasis in breast cancer.

To train Moroccan master trainers in screening and treating cervical cancer,Morocco recently launched a National Plan for Cancer Prevention and Control. Priority is being given to screening for cervical and breast cancers. As cytology screening for cervical cancer is not feasible throughout the country they have chosen to screen by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). The introduction of the nationwide scale cervical cancer screening program can be made on medium-term. With this aim in mind Lalla Salma Association against Cancer (ALSC) approached the Screening Group (SCR) at the International Agency for Research on Cancer to train 15 Moroccan master trainers in VIA and treatment of precancerous lesions by cold coagulation and loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). SCR has a large cervical cancer prevention program in rural India and proposes to run the training course there where they will be ensured of seeing women with various different cervical lesions for a successful hands-on training course.,http://www.uicc.org/programmes/global-education-and-training-initiative-geti/uicc-workshops,,Rengaswamy Sankaranarayanan,11/14/2016,11/14/2016,TRUE,FALSE,International Agency for Research on Cancer,Cours Albert Thomas,Lyon,France,,45.743411,4.875108,
